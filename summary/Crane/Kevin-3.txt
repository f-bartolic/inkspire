Who is the character?
Kevin is a deeply introspective crane operator, increasingly aware of the emotional and existential limits of his life. He seeks meaning through order and control but is haunted by disillusionment—about his past, his family, and his purpose.

What is his relationship with other characters?

His wife: Still absent. Her departure now represents a broader failure Kevin recognizes in himself—an inability to connect or sustain intimacy.

His son: Still visits. Kevin worries his son will see him as he now sees his own father—dispassionate, limited, unartistic.

His father: Remembered as a working man Kevin once idealized. The childhood fantasy of his father as an “iron artist” is shattered, and with it, a vision of potential he never followed.

His boss: Shows surprising trust and belief in Kevin’s abilities, offering him a pioneering role despite Kevin’s recent decline.

What are his thoughts?

He reflects on childhood disillusionment and feels emotionally overwhelmed.

Kevin now sees himself as having followed a predetermined, limited path—"a servant of the blueprint."

He fears professional failure but is unexpectedly uplifted by trust and opportunity.

The new crane renews his confidence and purpose—technical mastery gives him an identity and escape.
