Who is the character?
A memory. Once idealized by Kevin as a creative figure (“iron weaver”), but later understood as a conventional laborer. He represents a path Kevin unconsciously followed—and now regrets.

What is his relationship with other characters?

Kevin: His father’s image has shaped Kevin’s understanding of work and purpose. The realization that his father was not an artist but a technician mirrors Kevin’s own crisis of identity.

What are his thoughts?

Not directly expressed, but his silent presence in Kevin’s memory suggests stoicism and stability.
