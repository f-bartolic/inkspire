Who is the character?
Kevin is a gifted crane operator whose emotional world slowly emerges through the collapse of his personal life, a reconnection with the past, and ultimately a visionary act of rebellion and creation. He moves from control to chaos to creative liberation.

What is his relationship with other characters?

His wife: Remains in the background—a symbol of emotional failure and distance.

His son: Still visits, but remains quiet. Kevin wants to be more, but isn’t sure how.

His father: Now fully understood as a man constrained by his role. Kevin both identifies with and surpasses him.

His boss: Offers both punishment and support. Reacts with anger to Kevin’s stunt, but still represents institutional expectations.

First girlfriend: A catalyst. Her artistic success and self-assurance push Kevin toward reflection, crisis, and ultimately his own form of expression.

What are his thoughts?

He feels crushed by comparison, diminished by the life he didn’t choose.

His fever dream fuses art and machinery: cranes become dancers, cities become sculpture.

In his final act, Kevin reclaims agency—he reshapes the city in an imaginative, rule-breaking gesture that transforms infrastructure into art.

He glows with pride. This is the closest he’s come to feeling seen, to being something more.
