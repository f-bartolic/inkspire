    <article>
        <main>
            <div class="book">

                <section>
                    <p>Below it is misty but <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-1"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> peeks out above the
                        cloud. His clean shaven chin gleams in the morning sun. He takes a deep breath, it is still so
                        quiet,
                        and he is about to break the silence.</p>
                    <p>He wraps his hands around the controls, presses the pedals with his feet, hears the familiar
                        rattle of
                        the winches. A facade element for a future office complex rises up; he allows the jib to come
                        around in
                        the direction of the scaffold where laborers are already waiting to receive his little package.
                        They
                        wave to him, grinning.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-1" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is
                        the best,
                        he
                        knows it, and his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> says so too. He is precise, patient, quick. He is the
                        first
                        on every new tower crane that stretches a little higher and further, can lift more, the first to
                        climb
                        it, to steer it, to break it in. Other crane operators look up to him, literally and
                        figuratively, and
                        he feels good up there. He is fearless when it comes to heights, has impressive stamina. Can go
                        for
                        hours without a bathroom break. His head is empty, he loves that. His element is air and he is
                        in his
                        element.</p>
                    <p>Around eleven he gets his Thermos and lunch pail from his briefcase. There are colleagues that
                        come down
                        for lunch but he prefers eating up there. There are those that bring binoculars with them so
                        that they
                        can study the ants at ground level more closely, primarily the scantily clad on the balconies
                        and in the
                        backyards, he gets enough from the city itself, the outlines of the buildings, the layout of the
                        streets. The forms, the patterns, the colors. He drinks coffee and eats peanut butter sandwiches
                        and
                        enjoys the overview.</p>
                    <p>In his headset he hears his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> clear his throat. '<span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-1" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>,' he says, 'can you come
                        down?'</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-1" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>
                        wonders what
                        this
                        is about. His <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> is
                        a stickler for time, an announcement during dinner can only
                        mean a couple of things. He takes off his headset, puts his helmet on, gets into the little
                        lift,
                        glides
                        down the yellow mast with the last corner of sandwich in his hand. A new crane pops into his
                        head, a
                        new
                        model must have been announced, and his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> wants to arrange a test drive for him. It must be
                        something
                        like that.</p>
                    <p>When he walks into the site office he knows immediately that he had it all wrong. His <span
                            class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1" data-character="boss">boss</span> is
                        clutching a
                        thick envelope in both hands and eyeing it with suspicion. 'From a lawyer's office,' he says.
                        'Certified
                        mail.'</p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-1" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>
                        shrugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>'It's for you,' says his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-1"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span>.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-1" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> takes
                        the

                        rips it
                        open, lets a pile of documents slide out. The logo of the law firm on
                        the front page. His surname in the subject heading. A couple of measured paragraphs. The name of
                        his
                        <span class="character wife" data-summary-id="Wife-1" data-character="wife">wife</span>. The

                <section>
                    <p>The house is empty when he gets home. His <span class="character wife" data-summary-id="Wife-2"

                        going
                        down, himself walking into the site office. And he tries to steer his thoughts, to make his

                        speaking about a test drive, but every time he gets the divorce papers pressed into his hand
                        after all.

                        sorting it. He puts all the churches together. The parks next to the parks. He raises the crane
                        even
                        higher and sorts entire cities. Higher still and he sorts countries. The world is divided up
                        into
                        clearly defined elements in bright colors. It feels good once everything is in its place.</p>
                    <p>The days pass. <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-2"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> takes the lift up the mast and he is happy up there, he
                        takes
                        the lift down and he
                        is unhappy. The happiness is just big enough to make the unhappiness bearable. When his <span
                            class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-2" data-character="boss">boss</span> asks him
                        how it's going, he makes light of the situation. 'Me and my old lady never did get along so
                        well,' he
                        says.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-2" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> had
                        loved her
                        but in his own way, he had thought that she understood him. He had difficulty with
                        the things that spouses do: sitting together on the sofa, or in the sun, days out, chatting,
                        watching
                        TV. He would have preferred just to look at her.</p>
                    <p>On the weekends his son comes over. They don't talk but they are together. He values those
                        moments. But
                        his discomfort only passes on Monday morning, when he takes his place in the cabin, takes off
                        his
                        helmet, headset on, and wraps his hands around the controls. He looks at the horizon. Sorts
                        girders,
                        cylinders, cubes, sometimes a pyramid. He is only truly at home when other people are at a
                        distance.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-2" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is
                        not sure
                        why he accepted the invitation. The reunion of his grade school class in someone's
                        sprawling home. He drinks a couple of beers; that makes everything easier. The vaguely familiar
                        faces
                        evoke feelings of familiarity and anonymity. For the first time he shares the entire story,
                        about the
                        family that he had but lost. People react sympathetically, <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-2" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> feels seen.</p>
                    <p>He is about to leave when she comes in. He has to look closely but it's her. His first <span
                            class="character girlfriend" data-summary-id="Girlfriend-2"
                            data-character="girlfriend">girlfriend</span>, who
                        kissed him at school summer camp in sixth grade, on the edge of her bunk. She went on to high
                        school, he
                        went to vocational school, they never saw each other again. She recognizes him immediately,
                        walks over
                        and starts a conversation. She makes no effort to simplify her language, which highly educated
                        people
                        tend to do, and tells him about how she went self-employed as a visual artist, how she paints,
                        how she
                        studied art history but how in the end it was all too theoretical for her, how she has since
                        finished
                        art school, is preparing an exhibition she is nervous about.</p>
                    <p>He already has a marriage behind him, she is still just a girl - <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-2" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> feels a bitter jealousy that
                        he
                        can't put into words. 'Your eyes are still exactly the same,' she says, and he notices that he's
                        getting
                        angry. He says that he needs to go to the bathroom, grabs his jacket, disappears.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Later that week, when he's waiting for the next load and a seagull lands on the jib not far above
                        him, he
                        notices the composition, the seagull on a third of the triangle that forms the jib, stretching
                        towards
                        the horizon. He can't help but be reminded of his father. The iron weaver.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>'s
                        head is
                        usually empty when he works, he feels the slight sway of the crane in the wind and thinks
                        of nothing, not even the past. But now he remembers what he thought an iron weaver was when he
                        was a
                        little boy. In his imagination he had seen his father bending iron bars, making them into the
                        shapes of
                        animals, people, abstract figures. He wove everything he could conceive of as if it was nothing.
                        When
                        his father watched soccer, <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> saw an artist recovering from his creation. Until one
                        day his
                        father
                        took him along to the construction site and he discovered what he really did.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> had
                        shoved it
                        far enough down that he didn't have to feel it, a shipping container locked up in an
                        echoing hangar. He sees himself as a young boy of around eight, close-cropped hair, light blue
                        eyes, as
                        he looks in photos from that time, full of energy and conviction, head held so high. That boy
                        who has
                        just discovered that iron weavers prepare the framework around which concrete is poured, every
                        day the
                        same perpendicular reinforcement bars, every day the same grid.</p>
                    <p>And he can't remember the last time that he did this, but he cries. What was then a
                        disappointment is now
                        a tragedy. Because just like his father, <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is a servant of the blueprint, nothing more, nothing
                        less. Diverging from it was never a real proposition. There was no art in the house, he had no
                        artistic
                        uncle, no art teacher to help him on his way. Had he wanted a different life, he would have had
                        to
                        intervene himself and he never did. <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>'s little boy would be under no illusions about his
                        father's
                        artistic ambition. Nor about his ability to maintain normal relationships. At least <span
                            class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>'s
                        father had a
                        stable marriage.</p>
                    <p>His mood darkens. He feels trapped in the cabin. Reacts more slowly to the instructions that the
                        headset
                        pumps into his head. Begins to make cock-ups with the rigs.</p>
                    <p>Then he is called to his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-3"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> again. <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> fears the worst. His
                        unhappiness must be palpable, you must be
                        able to read it in his silhouette, a massive right angle with drooping shoulders. He is no
                        longer the
                        operator he once was, he is going to be fired, <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is certain of it. Last time,
                        his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-3" data-character="boss">boss</span> gave
                        him the
                        divorce papers, this time he's getting his redundancy letter.</p>
                    <p>But it turns out the opposite is true. His <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-3"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> hands him a folder about the latest model, an enormous
                        beast in bright green, with a revolutionary grabber that the crane operator can attach to most
                        objects
                        from his dashboard. You no longer need a man on the ground to attach the hook. Sure, you need
                        someone to
                        monitor, the manufacturer, Health and Safety and the union agree on that, but in theory it is
                        possible
                        to do without them.</p>
                    <p>'I want you to be the first one to try it,' his <span class="character boss"
                            data-summary-id="Boss-3" data-character="boss">boss</span> says.</p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is
                        overcome
                        by professional pride. He cannot resist; the sombreness remains but a grin spreads
                        across his face like a thin layer of tarmac over the top of it.</p>
                    <p>'You in?' asks his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-3"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span>.</p>
                    <p>'You bet your ass,' says <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>.</p>
                    <p>He does the test, the crane is good, they lease it and from that moment on <span
                            class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is
                        even higher, he
                        stretches even further, and the new grabber gives him even more control. Every crane sways
                        slightly
                        differently, he enjoys mastering the finer points. <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-3" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> is himself again, nothing but
                        concentration,
                        nothing but contentment. The world stays outside the cabin.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Until one morning, on the way to the construction site, he encounters his old classmate's poster.
                        The
                        opening of her exhibition. He climbs into his crane and, in a rush of controlled aggression,
                        lifts a
                        cement truck. He holds it perfectly level and sets it down gently on the other side of the site.
                        His
                        <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-4" data-character="boss">boss</span> is
                        furious. The
                        driver was still on his way in, the cement truck was empty, but even so. Everyone
                        is furious. <span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-4"
                            data-character="kevin">Kevin</span>
                        says he has just been so tired recently, which isn't true, but he knows how to play
                        the burnout game and his <span class="character boss" data-summary-id="Boss-4"
                            data-character="boss">boss</span> tells him to go home.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="character kevin" data-summary-id="Kevin-4" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> goes
                        and lies
                        on his lonely double bed and realizes that he really isn't well. At first he feels
                        hot, then cold again. Clammy. In his fever dream he goes to her exhibition, feels diminished by
                        her
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The next minute he is sitting in his new crane. Carrying out his tasks. Working the controls,
                        pushing the
                        buttons. He moves the hook in and out along the jib, hoisting it up and letting it drop again.
                        He hears
                        violins, the camera zooms out, the city is one big crane ballet. He turns pirouettes on his
                        mast, the
                        rest copy him. Everything moves in sync. And <span class="character kevin"
                            data-summary-id="Kevin-4" data-character="kevin">Kevin</span> wants to get out of bed but
                        can't manage it, as if
                        his spirit wants to leave but his body would rather hallucinate. Then he sees what he has made:
                        a mesh
                        of bars, bent, glowing, a woman's body.</p>
                    <p>All at once he is wide awake. Resolved. He takes a cold shower and walks back over to the
                        construction
                        site.</p>
                    <p>He gets into the lift, his rough silhouette zooms up the green mast. If you saw him standing
                        behind his
                        little window, looking out over the city, with the same bright blue eyes as back then, gliding
                        further
                        and further, you would smile just like he did.</p>
                    <p>By the time the city wakes and begins to realize what has changed in the night, he is all
                        finished.
                        Apartments have been lifted onto office buildings, schools set down next to ponds. In a parking
                        lot,
                        vertically stacked suv's form an expensive house of cards. City hall is leaning on the train
                        station,
                        creating an enormous slide. People raise their eyebrows. Children cheer. <span
