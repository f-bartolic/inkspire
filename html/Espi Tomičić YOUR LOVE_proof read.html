<p>Espi Tomičić</p><p>Your Love is King</p><p>	I	</p><p>the bed is big enough for two people</p><p>she and someone else</p><p>a table</p><p>two books</p><p>she and someone else</p><p>i cannot understand anyone</p><p>i brought a dictionary (german croatian)</p><p>and two big milka</p><p>chocolate bars for lunch dinner and over night</p><p>that is how i was remembering our shared life</p><p>before this the two of us exchanged 73 messages</p><p>each word a message</p><p>enter like inhale</p><p>73 more than over the last ten years</p><p>more than ever before</p><p>a missed call</p><p>a german phone number</p><p>a whatsapp message</p><p>i am calling you for support and cheer i am in the hospital</p><p>she quipped about the dinamo soccer team and cheering fans</p><p>so far only medical tests</p><p>enter like exhale</p><p>i did not call</p><p>because i am selfish</p><p>because i wanted us to be writing </p><p>to have the messages to remember</p><p>to mull over later</p><p>i brought a dictionary (german croatian)</p><p>to read the test results</p><p>there is room in the bed for two</p><p>i cannot write from her perspective</p><p>i cannot know how she feels</p><p>i cannot write the character of the woman who is speaking to me</p><p>i cannot create her motivation</p><p>complexity</p><p>to build a character for this text</p><p>i cannot write her</p><p>without knowing her</p><p>but i can write about her</p><p>about what she told me</p><p>about us</p><p>how i got to know her again now that i am a man</p><p>and squeezed my eyes tight shut</p><p>i try to remember when we last</p><p>slept together when i was a girl</p><p>there is room in the bed for two </p><p><br />let them chop off whatever they like</p><p>she said</p><p>but i thought of all the texts i have been reading about the</p><p>representation of women</p><p>i disgust myself</p><p>my own mother is writing me about her disease</p><p>but my thoughts are on literature</p><p>who are you to write about that</p><p>on the promenade in split</p><p>crammed into a cafe where they pile</p><p>books by each table</p><p>books that have assumed the color of coffee</p><p>because nobody has ever opened them</p><p>i imagined taking a glass and throwing it at</p><p>the wall of the hipster cafe</p><p>the whatsapp message</p><p>magnetic procedure infusion up down ct then</p><p>magnetic on a full stomach then antibiotic</p><p>a big wound</p><p>i wanted to throw a glass at the wall</p><p>but all i did was respond to my cell phone</p><p>calmest in the world</p><p>and asked have you eaten so what is the food like</p><p>that seemed logical</p><p>because concern for another is manifested through</p><p>feeding</p><p>as if i have any idea what she likes</p><p>besides chocolate</p><p>two big milkas</p><p>for lunch dinner and over night</p><p>i eat pudding</p><p>she listed the flavors for me</p><p>strawberry</p><p>chocolate</p><p>vanilla</p><p>banana</p><p>she described the way the food is served in the most minute </p><p>detail</p><p>everything that a person who cannot eat</p><p>observes</p><p>because she knows that silence over the phone has</p><p>special weight</p><p>let them chop off whatever they like</p><p>she said</p><p>she laughed</p><p>i said</p><p>german hospitals are better than ours</p><p>i do not know why</p><p>i have never been to germany</p><p>i know nothing about their hospitals </p><p>but i wanted her to feel safe</p><p>i said that and what i wanted to say was</p><p>everything will be fine</p><p>they have modern equipment and what matters is</p><p>you decided to go to the hospital</p><p>though i know this is not the case</p><p>and my brother made her go</p><p>although i know she knew what was happening for months</p><p>you talk to me about dinamo and cheering you on</p><p>and i stand there with beers and peanuts and tightly </p><p>squeeze my eyes shut</p><p>i try to remember when we last</p><p>slept together when i was a girl</p><p>i hate languages</p><p>and german</p><p>and hospitals that are far away</p><p>and i would prefer you being right here at vinogradska hospital</p><p>so we could go out in front of the building </p><p>and talk about the crappy equipment</p><p>about how somewhere else would be better</p><p>and getting to know each other in the city where we both</p><p>lived when i was a girl</p><p>where later i wandered as a man by night through the streets</p><p>and you stood at home by the phone</p><p>in the city where you had a child</p><p>and i had a mother</p><p>there is room in the bed for two</p><p>i am not at all sure you are telling the truth</p><p>i know that sounds terrible</p><p>how dare you talk with her like that</p><p>she is ill</p><p>she gave birth to you</p><p>be by her side</p><p>these are the toughest moments</p><p>the struggle is only beginning</p><p>this is not merely a physical thing</p><p>everything ends</p><p>this information is difficult to take in</p><p>be by her side</p><p>i imagine how it eats away at you</p><p>how your organs fail</p><p>how i hugged you as a child</p><p>and how your skin was soft</p><p>that part i invented</p><p>you have been a smoker for 40 years</p><p>never has your skin been soft</p><p>i cannot remember when i last hugged you</p><p>but i picture your body falling apart</p><p>and i break out in a sweat</p><p>i am scared</p><p>wait</p><p>do not rush</p><p>take it easy</p><p>i always had a thousand questions</p><p>this drove you crazy</p><p>when you drove 2000 kilometers</p><p>to another country</p><p>to father in jail</p><p>i could never sleep</p><p>a thousand questions</p><p>this drove you crazy</p><p>the 73 whatsapp messages</p><p>enter inhale</p><p>do not ask</p><p>wait</p><p>even i do not know everything yet</p><p>we will see</p><p>it is a tumor</p><p>they need to consult with a plastic surgeon</p><p>stop patience</p><p>enter exhale</p><p>i always panic about everything</p><p>but this has already happened to so many people</p><p>there is nothing so awful about it</p><p>i spoke with the world's calmest voice</p><p>but i wanted to throw a glass at the wall</p><p>mama</p><p>do you have any family history of cancer</p><p>i asked you</p><p>because at home there was never mention of it</p><p>you said they asked you that too but only after everything</p><p>your grandmother died of colon cancer</p><p>silence</p><p>colon cancer?</p><p>yes</p><p>you said yes</p><p>but what you meant to say was</p><p>yes grandma had cancer</p><p>and we lied to you children that it was a ruptured</p><p>appendix</p><p>so you two would not worry or think about it</p><p>i did not say anything</p><p>your grandmother died of cancer</p><p>reverberated in my head</p><p>i remembered every no i circled</p><p>every consent in the transition process </p><p>every form</p><p>i have no family history of cancer</p><p>and this is why i shoot up testosterone</p><p>and why i am confident when the lady psychologist </p><p>says</p><p>cancer it is often a congenital disease</p><p>and if it does not appear in your family history</p><p>that is good news for a hypochondriac</p><p>i am scared for myself</p><p>i am obsessed with palpating my breasts</p><p>i asked you</p><p>do they remove the whole breast</p><p>and i wanted to ask</p><p>mama</p><p>has it spread</p><p>how big is it</p><p>i wanted to hear</p><p>they only remove that part</p><p>but you said you do not know</p><p>and added</p><p>let them chop off what they like and laughed</p><p>luckily you have breasts like grandma had</p><p>and besides i only wear a size one</p><p>i imagined you saying to me</p><p>what do you know about that</p><p>and about the flint of a cigarette lighter </p><p>on the sixth floor of a hospital in germany</p><p>the feeling when i go out alone onto the balcony for smokers </p><p>and how i felt while i was carrying you in my</p><p>belly</p><p>and when we conceived you 2000 kilometers away</p><p>during an open visit to a prison in the netherlands</p><p>how could you know anything at all about how i feel</p><p>from that armchair of yours</p><p>and empty word processor</p><p>and how you turn our shared grief into</p><p>material for writing</p><p>what do you know about that</p><p>when we exchanged the 73 messages over</p><p>whatsapp</p><p>73 more than over the last ten years</p><p>i imagine you telling me all that</p><p>but all you do is pretend nothing is happening</p><p>and talk to me about food</p><p>because that is what i asked you </p><p>the other day i was still appalled about the drama of a</p><p>woman</p><p>(a prominent italian woman writer)</p><p>who wrote about migrants</p><p>from her armchair</p><p>in her sparsely designed home</p><p>and here am i</p><p>my very own mother has cancer</p><p>that is consuming her organs</p><p>and i am drinking beer</p><p>in another country</p><p>in another city</p><p>and writing about imminent death</p><p>or healing</p><p>holy shit</p><p>once a person told me about their</p><p>experience</p><p>in the context of me being transgendered</p><p>and having my breasts reduced</p><p>she told me she is thinking about doing it</p><p>though she is not trans</p><p>because her grandmother and mother died of breast cancer</p><p>how candid she is</p><p>and brave</p><p>i thought</p><p>i thought long and hard about those lives</p><p>and about her feeling this every day</p><p>fears for her own life</p><p>i thought long and hard</p><p>about how she says to herself</p><p>breathe in</p><p>slowly</p><p>do not rush</p><p>wait</p><p>and then it happened to you</p><p>and i ask you about the food </p><p>because concern for another is manifested through</p><p>food</p><p>because i actually wanted you to be in the city where</p><p>we were together when i was a girl</p><p>where i had a mother</p><p>and you had a child</p><p>breathe out</p><p>message</p><p>pick up</p><p>holy shit</p><p>what is happening</p><p>hi bro</p><p>hey</p><p>is everything okay</p><p>he is crying</p><p>my brother never cries</p><p>is everything okay</p><p>no it is not where you are</p><p>in split what happened</p><p>it has spread</p><p>embolism to both lungs</p><p>her liver</p><p>pointless to operate</p><p>listen i think that</p><p>listen i think that</p><p>long pause</p><p>dunno</p><p>they will prolong her life for as long as they can</p><p>i say nothing</p><p>are you still there he asks</p><p>i am </p><p>sorry</p><p>i tell him sorry</p><p>as if you are not my mother too</p><p>i tell him sorry</p><p>because you truly were that for him</p><p>because you two are bonded in ways i cannot even imagine</p><p>i wanted to tell him everything would be fine</p><p>i did not say that to him</p><p>we do not talk that way</p><p>we know life is never fine</p><p>sorry</p><p>i repeat once more</p><p>love you bro</p><p>call</p><p>i am here</p><p>right?</p><p>i go back to the table as if nothing has happened</p><p>pay for the coffee</p><p>walk</p><p>i do not know where i am</p><p>panic attacks</p><p>an everyday thing</p><p>nothing new</p><p>cut the melodrama</p><p>i repeat to myself </p><p>you have no right to make yourself the victim</p><p>i told my brother i love him</p><p>i had not said that to him for 10 years</p><p>poor me while i stand in the breeze by the sea and</p><p>wait for the bus</p><p>because split is a foreign city</p><p>because i am nauseous</p><p>because i need my bed</p><p>diazepams</p><p>and my bathtub</p><p>because i need to be a grown up and pack my suitcase</p><p>on the bus for eight hours i imagined</p><p>a place you two have been existing for years</p><p>a place i have never been</p><p>in your room i see the blanket you covered yourself with</p><p>the blanket under which i tucked my hand so often</p><p>took the remote and switched off the tv when you were already</p><p>fast asleep</p><p>and i came in high from being out</p><p>the blanket full of burn holes because you fell asleep </p><p>a hundred times with a cigarette in your hand</p><p>the blanket i used to cover my mouth when i</p><p>vomited in the room from drugs</p><p>so i would be quieter</p><p>so you would not hear me</p><p>i remember we had the blanket when we lived</p><p>together back when i was a girl</p><p>we all had it</p><p>brother</p><p>you</p><p>and me</p><p>that blanket is the only familiar thing i can</p><p>connect to you</p><p>i do not know you</p><p>i do not even know your favorite song</p><p>ever since i heard that you are dying</p><p>i have been calling you mama</p><p>mama</p><p>mama</p>
